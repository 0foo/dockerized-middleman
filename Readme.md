## Dockerized Middleman

### To Use

1. `docker-compose build`
1. `docker-compose up`

* That's it!
* Live reload should be enabled.
* If you have any issues or need to change anything ruby related just restart the container with:
    1. `docker-compose down`
    1. `docker-compose up`


Edit: I love Middleman but apparently the [middleman-blog plugin](https://github.com/middleman/middleman-blog) appears to be no longer maintained and I switched to Jekyll.
